# PHP MVC Framework

## Overview

This project provides an MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework developed in PHP following the great tutorial from Quick Programming on youtube, designed to simplify the creation of structured and maintainable web applications. It serves as a foundation for developing projects that adhere to the MVC paradigm, clearly separating business logic, presentation, and data control.

## Features

- **Command-Line Tools**: Supports the creation of models, controllers, and entities directly via command line for faster development.

## Project Structure

- **app/**: Contains the application controllers, models, and views.
- **public/**: Publicly accessible directory containing the application entry point (`index.php`) and public assets.
- **thunder/**: Contains templates for generating files such as models, controllers, and entities through command-line commands, streamlining the development process.
